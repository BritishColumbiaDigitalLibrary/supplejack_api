Dear DigitalNZ developer,

The DigitalNZ account associated with this email address currently has a limit of <%= @limit %> DigitalNZ API calls per day. You exceeded this number API requests today. This might have happened because you have created an application that many people are using or because you have edited a large number of sets.

Your API key is unable to make further requests until tomorrow.

We encourage you to get in contact with us to discuss a higher daily rate. Drop us an email to develop@digitalnz.org and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.

For the DigitalNZ API Terms of Use see: http://www.digitalnz.org/about/terms-of-use/developer-api-terms-of-use
General DigitalNZ information for developers: http://www.digitalnz.org/developers

All the best,
DigitalNZ
