Dear DigitalNZ developer,

The DigitalNZ account associated with this email address currently has a limit of <%= @limit %> DigitalNZ API calls per day. So far today, you have used 90% of these API requests. This might have happened because you have created an application that many people are using or because you have edited a large number of sets.

If you exceed <%= @limit %> API calls today you will be unable to make anymore requests until tomorrow.

We encourage you to get in contact with us to discuss a higher daily rate. Drop us an email to develop@digitalnz.org and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.

For the DigitalNZ API Terms of Use see: http://www.digitalnz.org/about/terms-of-use/developer-api-terms-of-use
General DigitalNZ information for developers: http://www.digitalnz.org/developers

All the best,
DigitalNZ
